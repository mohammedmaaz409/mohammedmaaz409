Hello, I'm Maaz, an MBA graduate with ten years of professional experience. 

When I first entered the corporate world, I was introduced to Microsoft Excel. Initially, I used it to manually track my daily work by entering data each day. However, I often found myself performing repetitive tasks in Excel, which led me to explore automation through Macros. As I delved deeper into this area, I developed a passion for data, particularly relational data. I began working with large datasets and eventually integrated my Excel spreadsheets into Microsoft Power BI.

In my previous role at Nokia, I accomplished the following:

- Demonstrated strong data skills in cleaning, manipulating, and creating reports that provided clear, actionable insights.
- Contributed to saving over $3 million in operational costs by identifying and reducing redundant resources across various projects.
- Developed clear and concise reporting, which supported the company in winning the same project three consecutive times.
- Achieved a promotion to Technical Project Manager due to successful project outcomes and an effective problem-solving approach.
- Trained 10 new engineers on data quality and data reporting.
  
In 2022, I moved to the USA to pursue an MBA in Information Systems, focusing on managing technology companies, especially in emerging fields like AI, machine learning, and data analytics. 
Currently, I work as a Data Analyst. In both my professional and personal projects, I have extensively used tools such as SQL, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and Excel for Business Intelligence, importing data from various sources including SQL Server, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and JIRA.

For each project, I adopt a structured problem-solving approach that includes:

1. Clearly define the problem statement.
2. Identifying the root cause of the problems and formulating a hypothesis.
3. Identifying the required data tables from the databases.
4. Writing SQL queries to extract, clean, and prepare data for visualization.
5. Creating interactive dashboards with actionable insights.
6. Conducting A/B testing and piloting solutions based on hypothesis validation.
